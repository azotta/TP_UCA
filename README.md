## Basic terminal commands

1-	Open your terminal 

2-	Identify where you are located 
```
pwd
```

3- Create a directory under your Documents 
```
mkdir TP_Genomics
```

4- Navigate to your new directory
```
cd TP_Genomics
```
5 - List the files 
```
ls -la
```
6 - Create a file with some text inside: 
```
echo "putyourtexthere" > file.txt
```
7 - Read your text
To read your text you have several options. 
To simple print everything directly to the terminal 
```
more file.txt
```
To show your file but not print on the terminal 
```
less file.txt
```
To visualize and edit your file
```
vi file.txt

nano file.txt
```

8 - Now, change the name of your file: 
```
mv file.txt test.txt
```

9 - Move your file to another directory
```
mv test.txt /home/user/Documents (change accordling to your computer!)
```

10 - Delete your file 
```
rm test.txt
```


## Fastq and Fasta files

1 - Download the file Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz from the OneDrive link 

2 - Move the file to your new directory
```
mv /path/download/Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz .
```
3 - List the files on your new directory
```
ls -la
```
4 - Use zcat to read a .gz file
```
zcat Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz |less

for mac users:
zcat < Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz |less
```

5 - How many sequences your file have? (Here you have two options: decompress the file or do all the analysis using the command above before the pipe)
```
To decompress you file:
gzip -d Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa.gz
To count the number of sequences
grep '>' Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa |wc
```
6 - How many letters on the sequences? 
```
awk '/^>/{if (l!="") print l; print; l=0; next}{l+=length($0)}END{print l}' Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.chromosome.1.fa
```

7 - Based on the header of the sequences, which kind of sequence is this? 

8 - Download the file SRR4242474_1.fastq.gz 

9 - Move the file to your TP_Genomics directory

10 - Repeat the command to decompress the file

10.1 - Check the size of the file decompressed and the compressed, what is the size in Gb ? 
```
ls -latrh
```
11 - How many lines do you have? Could you guess how many sequences do you have? 

12 - Visualize the file using "more"  or "less"

13 - Are these sequences from a short or long read technology ? 

14 - How would you count the number of sequences in this kind of file?
